# Twitter Follower Count
You know that in the web version of Twitter, to see the number of followers of a user, you can hold the mouse over his profile picture. But when the number of users is large, for example, when we receive many notifications from many users. or when you are browsing Twitter; Checking individual users is a time-consuming task.

With this lightweight plugin, the number of followers is displayed automatically above the profile picture of each user without any clicks. So one look at the page is enough.

Note that to avoid additional overhead, the code is executed after each scroll. So if nothing appears the first time, just scroll the mouse once.
